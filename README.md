# Just-Average

Sometimes you gotta think about a question mathematically ðŸ¤ 

***Question: Given a list of integers nums and an integer k, return true if you can remove exactly one element from the list to make the average equal to exactly k.***

Yea this was p easy ðŸ˜Œ

Average = Sum of Terms / Num of Terms

We're basically making the Sum of Terms the subject and then subtracting to find the element that can be removed from the list (if any).
